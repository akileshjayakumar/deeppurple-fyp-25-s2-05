# UOW Final Year Project - DeepPurple - S2 2025

## Project Information

**Project ID:** CSIT-25-S2-21  
**Group Number:** FYP-S2-25-05  
**Proposed Title:** DeepPurple  
**Project Start Date:** Saturday, April 05, 2025

## Project Description

Effective communication is about more than just exchanging information. It’s about understanding the emotions and intentions behind the words. **DeepPurple** is the solution.

DeepPurple is a text analysis software that automates the process of analyzing client communications, deciphering the emotions they express, and providing a deep understanding of what they are saying and how they feel. This solution is designed to scale to millions of communications and customers.

Through its AI engine, this natural language analysis software mines emotions, identifies their context, and presents insights in an interactive and adaptive user interface (UI). Companies will be empowered to better understand their clients and customize their approach to every aspect of their business. Additionally, DeepPurple offers comprehensive insights into both detailed and general trends over time.

**We turn words into insights.**

## Project Problem Statement

In today’s communication-heavy environment, businesses and individuals manage large volumes of unstructured client interactions across email, chat, and feedback channels (Williams, B. 2025). Most existing sentiment analysis tools are built for enterprise users and focus only on surface-level polarity, lacking the depth to interpret emotional nuance or changing sentiment over time.

Solutions like IBM Watson NLU, Google Cloud NLP, and Amazon Comprehend offer basic entity and sentiment analysis but often require manual setup, lack flexibility, and are not accessible to smaller teams or individual users. This leads to slow insights, inconsistent interpretation, and underutilised data.

DeepPurple fills this gap with a SaaS-based, AI-powered communication analysis platform that automates emotion detection, summarisation, and insight generation. It enables both professionals and teams to understand their clients with clarity, speed, and scale.
